# Advent of Code

This is the collection of all my solutions for the advent of code challenges.
Probably not much in here, haven't been very good at completing these.

Will try and get 2020 done, definitely will get 2021 finished.

## How to Run

I've used the Deno TypeScript runtime for all these solutions, so to use you will
need to install Deno.

```shell
cargo install deno --locked
```

Then to run any of the solutions, you do:

```shell
deno run --allow-read 2021/dayOne/puzzleOne.ts
```
